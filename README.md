# complete-stop-application
Small page for an Assignment from a company

Due to the limited time for the assignment, I concentrated on a good and clean design and on responsiveness of the application, as well as visualizing the data of the stops.

I would still have to implement the button functions with another page, which will be shown when the User completed a stop. Moreover, the report-button still has to be put on the page.
In general, it would have been more efficient to use a JS-Framework. But due to the given time, I couldn't afford to work myself into a new Framework, so I used what I got.
